- KPI cards (Total Products, Active / Pending counts, Total Stock)

- Selection control to change how many products are loaded (10 / 50 / 100 / 500)
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap utilities
- Environment-specific `.env` files included (`.env.development`, `.env.production`)

## Tech stack (inferred)

- Vue (Vue CLI / Vue 3 assumed)
- ApexCharts (`vue3-apexcharts`)
- Bootstrap classes for layout
- Element UI / Element Plus used for select (`el-select` seen in code)
- Axios or a service file for API calls (e.g. `@/service/ProductService`)
